# LED-Voltmeter-using-IC-741
This project is an LED voltmeter using 741 IC op-amps configured as comparators to visually display voltage levels. As input voltage increases, different LEDs light up based on preset thresholds. Itâ€™s a simple and effective way to understand op-amp comparators and voltage indication circuits.
